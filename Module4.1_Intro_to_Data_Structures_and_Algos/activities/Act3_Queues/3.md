`deque` is a library which, when imported, provides ready-made commands such as the `append()` command for enqueuing and the `popleft()` command for dequeuing. However, a deque is a double-ended queue. This means that insertions and deletions can occur at *either* end. This library also includes the functions `appendleft()` and `pop()` which will insert values from the left end and delete values from the right end respectively.

```python
# Importing the library
from collections import deque

# Creating a Queue
queue = deque([1,5,8,9])

# Enqueuing elements to the Queue
queue.append(7) #[1,5,8,9,7]
queue.append(0) #[1,5,8,9,7,0]

# Dequeuing elements from the Queue
queue.popleft() #[5,8,9,7,0]
queue.popleft() #[8,7,9,0]

#Printing the elements of the Queue
print(queue)
```

Try using the *popleft()* command after the queue is empty and see what you get. Post the ways in which you can handle this issue.
