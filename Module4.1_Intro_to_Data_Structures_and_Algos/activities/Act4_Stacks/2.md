### How to implement Stack?

Now that you know what a Stack is, let's get started with the implementation!

### Stack implementation

![stackbooks](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Lifo_stack.png)

Here we are going to define a class Stack and add methods to perform the below operations:

1. Push elements into a Stack
2. Pop elements from a Stack and issue a warning if itâ€™s empty
3. Get the size of the Stack
4. Print all the elements of the Stack

---

###  Create Stack in Python

Here we create our class `Stack` which will build our Stack with the attributes that comply to its structure. Within the class, we first will create the constructor which simply defines a `stack` object as a list.

```python
class Stack:

    #Constructor creates a list
    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = list()
```

---

#### Push elements (add elements)

Since our stack is simply just a list as of now, we will now need to add the attributes which make it a stack. We still start off by defining the `push()` function which is for adding elements into our stack. 

**Two Parameters :** 

*self :*   which refers to our stack objects 

*data* : which is the data element you wish to add into the stack.

**Steps :**

1. Use python `append` function to add element to the end of the list (which is the top of our stack) and return *True*.

```python
    #Adding elements to stack
    def push(self,data):
        self.stack.append(data)
        return True
```

---

#### Pop element (take element out of stack)

Now that we have the functionality to add to our stack, we must also have the ability to take elements out of our stack. Rememeber that stacks follow **LIFO (last-in first-out)** order which means the last element added in is the first element that gets removed. Our `pop()` function will be used to accomplish the removal of elements from our stack.

**One Parameter :** 

*self :*   which refers to our stack objects 

**Steps :**

1. Check if the length of our stack is less than or equal to zero in order to confirm if its empty or not. 
2. If it is indeed empty, then we will return a print statement indicating that it's empty. 
3. Otherwise, we know it is not empty. Use python `pop()` function, which will return the last element of the list (which is the top of our stack), and remove it.

```python
    #Removing last element from the stack
    def pop(self):
        if len(self.stack)<=0:
            return ("Stack Empty!")
        return self.stack.pop()
```

---

#### Size of Stack

Last, the only remaining function to accomplish our stack implementation is `size()` which simply just returns the size of our stack (how many elements are in the stack). 

**One Parameter :** 

*self :*   which refers to our stack objects 

**Steps :**

1. Use python `len` function to return the lenth of the list (which is defined as our stack).

```python
    #Getting the size of the stack
    def size(self):
        return len(self.stack)
```

---

### Class of Stack

Here is our full implementation of `Stack` altogether:

```python
class Stack:

    #Constructor creates a list
    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = list()
        
    #Adding elements to stack
    def push(self,data):
        self.stack.append(data)
        return True
      
    #Removing last element from the stack
    def pop(self):
        if len(self.stack)<=0:
            return ("Stack Empty!")
        return self.stack.pop()
      
    #Getting the size of the stack
    def size(self):
        return len(self.stack)
```

> NOTE: Since the stack is represented by a list, the size of our stack size is dynamic which implies that we do not have concerns for increasing and decreasing our stack to whichever length of elements.
