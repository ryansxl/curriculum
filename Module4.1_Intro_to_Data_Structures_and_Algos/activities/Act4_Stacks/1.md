In this section you are about to learn one of the very basic and most useful data structure concepts known as a **Stack**.

 data structure **Stack** can be shown as below:

> The above image is **Stack Data Structure**. A Stack is a **Last In First Out (LIFO)** data structure. It supports two basic operations called **push** and **pop**. The **push**  operation *adds* an element at the **top of the stack**, and the **pop** operation *removes* an element from the **top of the stack**.

When you hear the word Stack, the first thing that comes to your mind may be a stack of books, and we can use this analogy to explain stacks easily! Some of the commonalities include:

1. There is a book at the top of the stack (if there is only one book in the stack, then that will be considered the topmost book).
2. Only when you remove the topmost book can you get access to the bottom ones. No Jenga games here! (Also assume that you can only lift one book at a time).
3. Once you remove all the books from the top one by one, there will be none left and hence you cannot remove any more books.

To describe the above points more programmatically:

1. Keep track of the topmost element as this will give you the information about the number of elements in the stack and whether the stack is empty/full (if the stack is empty then top will be set to 0 or a negative number)
2. The last element to enter the stack will always be the first to leave (Last In First Out - LIFO)
3. If all the elements are removed, then the stack is empty and if you try to remove elements from an empty stack, a warning or an error message is thrown.
4. If the stack has reached its maximum limit and you try to add more elements, a warning or error message is thrown.

**Things to remember :**

1. The entry and exit of elements happens only from the top of the stack 
2. Push - Adding an element to the Stack (at the **top of the stack**)
3. Pop - Removing an element from the Stack (at the **top of the stack**)
4. Random access is not allowed - you cannot add or remove an element from the middle.

Note: **Always keep track of the Top.** This tells us the status of the stack.
