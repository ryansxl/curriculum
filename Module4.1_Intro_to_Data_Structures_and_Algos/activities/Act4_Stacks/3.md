#### Initialize Stack

Using our `Stack` implementation, we can now use it as a data structure for storing and removing data elements. To begin using our stack, we need to initialize it as such:

```python
myStack = Stack()
```

---

#### Add elements

The variable `myStack` is now a stack object that is capable of using the functions we previously defined for our stack. Let's add some elements into our stack via `push()`, I will also print the operations in order for you to see that they have happened successfully since the function returns a boolean:

```python
myStack = Stack()
print(myStack.push(5)) #prints whether the operation "push" successes
print(myStack.stack)   #print the stack(left is bottom of the stack,right is the top of stack)
print(myStack.push(6)) 
print(myStack.stack)
print(myStack.push(9)) 
print(myStack.stack)
print(myStack.push(5)) 
print(myStack.stack)
print(myStack.push(3)) 
print(myStack.stack)
```

**result of the code :**

Thus, our stack should now look as such: [5, 6, 9, 5, 3].

#### Return Size of Stack

If we check the size of our stack we can do so as such:

```python
print(myStack.size())   
```

**result of the code :**

<img src="https://projectbit.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/darlene/labs/stacks2.jpg" alt="2" style="zoom:50%;" />

and we see that the size of `myStack` is 5!

---

#### Remove elements

Now we can proceed to remove the elements from our stack which is simply just calling `pop()` on `myStack`:

```python
print(myStack.pop())   #print the value of removed element
print("stack now :",myStack.stack)   #print the stack now
print(myStack.pop())
print("stack now :",myStack.stack)
print(myStack.pop())
print("stack now :",myStack.stack)
print(myStack.pop())
print("stack now :",myStack.stack)
print(myStack.pop())
print("stack now :",myStack.stack)
print("the size of the stack now :",myStack.size())  #print the size of stack
print(myStack.pop())
```

**result of the code :**

<img src="https://projectbit.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/darlene/labs/stacks3.jpg" />

Since `myStack` only contained 5 elements, the stack became empty after calling `pop()` five times as seen when we check the size again. Then upon calling `pop()` for the sixth time, we see that "Stack Empty!" is printed.
