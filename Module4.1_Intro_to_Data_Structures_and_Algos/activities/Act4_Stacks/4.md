Stack data structure in a wide range of practical applications, they are often able to solve many problems. Next we use the stack to solve an interesting game problem——*Tower of Hanoi*.

### Application Of Stack —— Tower of Hanoi

Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle. It consists of three poles and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any poles. The puzzle starts with the disk in a neat stack in ascending order of size in one pole, the smallest at the top thus making a conical shape. The objective of the puzzle is to move all the disks from one pole (say ‘source pole’) to another pole (say ‘destination pole’) with the help of the third pole (say auxiliary pole).

The puzzle has the following  **two rules** :

1. You can’t place a larger disk onto smaller disk
2. Only one disk can be moved at a time

With our stack implementation, we can go ahead and solve the Tower of Hanoi. Each pole (tower) will be represented by a stack and each disk will be represented as a data element that is stored in the stack. 

**Assumption :**

3 disks and 3 poles(towers).  Below is a visual representation:

> Note: the left, middle and right poles correspond respectively to the source, auxililary and destination.

Our objective is to get the stack of disks you see above in the source pole over to the destination pole in the exact same order without stacking a larger disk onto a smaller disk.

**Step 0)  Initialize**

Let's initialize all the items we need and properly set up our puzzle. 

```python
sourcePole = Stack()
auxPole = Stack()
destPole = Stack()

smallDisk = 1
avgDisk = 2
largeDisk = 3

sourcePole.push(largeDisk)
sourcePole.push(avgDisk)
sourcePole.push(smallDisk)

print(sourcePole.stack)  # print the Initial state of 3 poles
print(auxPole.stack)
print(destPole.stack)
```

**result of the code :**

> Note: remember that stack is LIFO so we must `push()` our elements in the appropriate order, the source pole has the `largeDisk` at the bottom and `smallDisk` at the top.

---

**Step 1)**

Now let's proceed to solving this puzzle! For our first move, we can only remove the top disk which is `smallDisk`. We will place the `smallDisk` on the destination pole.

```python
disk = sourcePole.pop() #remove the top disk of source pole to destination pole
destPole.push(disk)

print(sourcePole.stack) #print the state now
print(auxPole.stack)
print(destPole.stack)
```

**result of the code :**

<img src="https://projectbit.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/darlene/labs/stacks6.jpg" alt="6" style="zoom:50%;" />

---

**Step 2)**

Next, we will put the `avgDisk` onto the auxililary pole. Each pole will now have exactly 1 disk.

```python
disk = sourcePole.pop() #remove the top disk of source pole now to destination pole
auxPole.push(disk)

print(sourcePole.stack) #print the state now
print(auxPole.stack)
print(destPole.stack)
```

**result of the code :**

<img src="https://projectbit.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/darlene/labs/stacks7.jpg" alt="7" style="zoom:50%;" />

---

**Step 3)**

Knowing that we want to put the `largeDisk` first into the destination pole, we need to move the `smallDisk`. So let's put the `smallDisk` on top of the `avgDisk` on the auxiliary pole.

```python
disk=destPole.pop()
auxPole.push(disk)

print(sourcePole.stack)
print(auxPole.stack)
print(destPole.stack)
```

**result of the code :**

<img src="https://projectbit.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/darlene/labs/stacks8.jpg" alt="8" style="zoom:50%;" />

---

**Step 4)**

Now the destination pole is free for us to put the `largeDisk` in first.

```python
disk=sourcePole.pop()
destPole.push(disk)

print(sourcePole.stack)
print(auxPole.stack)
print(destPole.stack)
```

**result of the code :**

<img src="https://projectbit.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/darlene/labs/stacks9.jpg" alt="9" style="zoom:50%;" />

---

**Step 5)**

Our goal now is to get the `avgDisk` on top of the `largeDisk` in the destination pole, but `smallDisk` is in the way so let's move that back to the source pole.

```python
disk=auxPole.pop()
sourcePole.push(disk)

print(sourcePole.stack)
print(auxPole.stack)
print(destPole.stack)
```

**result of the code :**

<img src="https://projectbit.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/darlene/labs/stacks10.jpg" alt="10" style="zoom:50%;" />

---

**Step 6)**

The `avgDisk` is now free to be put on top of the `largeDisk` in the destination pole so we will do so now.

```python
disk=auxPole.pop()
destPole.push(disk)

print(sourcePole.stack)
print(auxPole.stack)
print(destPole.stack)
```

 **result of the code :**

<img src="https://projectbit.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/darlene/labs/stacks11.jpg" alt="11" style="zoom:50%;" />

---

**Step 7)**

Finally, we just need to put the `smallDisk` onto our destination pole and we will have completed our Tower of Hanoi puzzle!

```python
disk=sourcePole.pop()
destPole.push(disk)

print(sourcePole.stack)
print(auxPole.stack)
print(destPole.stack)
```

**result of the code :**
