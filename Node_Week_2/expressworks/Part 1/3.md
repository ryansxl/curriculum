<!--title={Good Old Form}-->

Forms are important. This exercise will teach you how to process the traditional (non-AJAX) web form.

Your goal is to write a route (`'/form'`) that processes HTML form input
(`<form><input name="str"/></form>`) and responds with the value of `str` backwards.



Express.js uses middleware to provide extra functionality to your web server.

**Middleware** is software that lies between an operating system and the applications running on it. Functioning as hidden translation layer, middleware enables communication and data management for distributed applications.

Simply put, a middleware is a function invoked by Express.js before your own request handler.

Middleware provide a large variety of functionality such as logging, serving static files, and error handling.

A middleware is added by calling `use()` on the application and passing the middleware as a parameter.



Let's use one! To parse `x-www-form-urlencoded` request bodies, Express.js can use the `urlencoded()` middleware from the `body-parser` module. You may need to do the following command in your terminal before using the `body-parser` module:

```sh
$ npm install body-parser
```

After we've installed the body-parser module, we can require it in our app. 

```js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

const bodyparser = require('body-parser')
app.use(bodyparser.urlencoded({extended: false}))
```



To handle a POST request, use the `post()` method, the same way we use the `get()` method:

```js
app.post('/path', function(req, res){...})
```



Here is how we can print characters backwards (just one way to do it):

```js
app.post('/path', function(req, res){
	const reversedString = req.body.str.split('').reverse().join('')
  res.send(reversedString)
});
```

Let's break everything down. We're using the `post()` method to add something to our database, with methodology similar to how we use the `get()` method. Then, we're getting the *body* of the request and reversing it. Finally, we respond with teh reversed string that we had just received.
