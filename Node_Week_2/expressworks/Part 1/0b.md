<!--title={Introduction to REST APIs}-->

In the previous card we defined an API. Now, let's explore what a REST API is. 

**REST** stands for Representational State Transfer, and has operations that match four basic web operations (**CRUD**):

| CRUD                 | REST APIs | Meaning                           |
| -------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------- |
| **C**reate           | Post      | Creates data in server            |
| **R**ead (retrieve)  | Get       | Retrieves data from server        |
| **U**pdate (modify)  | Put       | Update and replace data in server |
| **D**elete (destroy) | Delete    | Delete data from server           |

We'll be using all four of the above operations!



Servers implement some form of REST API to allow http requests to carry through their routes and send back an appropriate status code.
