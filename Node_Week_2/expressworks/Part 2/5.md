This exercise is about using URL parameters! Oftentimes, URLs are more than just the route of the page. They can also give your page values that wouldn't be available otherwise. 

For example, if a URL is `/message/:526aa677a8ceb64569c9d4fb`, the route is `/message/`, and `/526aa677a8ceb64569c9d4fb` is the parameter. In this case, that long string is the id of the message, but the parameter could be any variable you want to pass in. 



We're going to utilize URL parameters, creating an Express.js server that processes PUT requests. To start, let's require our modules. 

```js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
```

The way to access the id in a route is using the format `/message/:id` . We already know how to create a PUT request for an app, so we just have to put them together.  

```js
app.put('/message/:id', function(req, res){
  const id = req.params.id
  ...
})
```

In the second line, we're getting our id! You can use a `console.log()` to double check the value of the id!

Our function should also *hash* the id, so that hackers can't use the data. Let's add a SHA-1 hash. 

**SHA-1** stands for Secure Hash Algorithm 1, and performs what is called a *message digest* on an input. The output of the message digest will be a converted value by a certain function. 

So, if the server receives a PUT request for `'/message/526aa677a8ceb64569c9d4fb'` it should respond with a hash of the current date (as a string) and the ID.



The SHA-1 can be computed like this:

```js
const str = require('crypto')
  .createHash('sha1')
  .update(new Date().toDateString() + id)
  .digest('hex')

res.send(str)
```



Great job, the final step is to have your app listen to the port on  `process.argv[2]`.
