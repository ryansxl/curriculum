# Separation of Concerns Part 3
This is the third and final exercise to display the concept of Separation of Concerns.

We have already separated out all of the balance and change methods, so the only ones left (besides the actual vending machine's) have to do with products. Take the two methods that relate to products and move them into `productInventory.js`.

Make sure that the new `productInventory` is now calling the functions, run the tests, and you will have a Vending Machine whose concerns are fully separated.
