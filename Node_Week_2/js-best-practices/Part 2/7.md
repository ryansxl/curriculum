#Bad Practices

The goal of this exercise is to learn to be able to identify bad practices in code. First, take the `Best Practices Quiz`
located in the lower menu. Then open `balanceManager.js` and fix all of the mistakes you find there.

Both of these exercises draw from the Javascript Best Practices Curriculum which can be found here: https://github.com/excellalabs/the-javascript-curriculum.
It might be a good idea to look it over if you have not already.
