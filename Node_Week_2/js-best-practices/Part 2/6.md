# TDD
This exercise will test your ability to write code based off of the tests that are provided. Using Test-Driven Development, you write the tests for the functionality that you want to implement first. Then, you write the code for the method so that the tests you initially wrote.

The tests in this exercise are provided, but they will drive the design of the function you will implement, convertToChange(). convertToChange() should take in a single integer number in cents (e.g. $0.89 = 89) and return an array of strings representing the coins that would add up to this number. For example, if we input 76 cents, we would expect to return ['p', 'q', 'q', 'q'].

Keep in mind that the array of coins should be in the highest order in terms of coin value. For example, if 26 is the parameter, you should return 1 penny and 1 quarter in the array, even though you could technically return several other combinations of coins (e.g. 2 dimes, 1 nickel, 1 penny).

Run the tests in this exercise to see what the expected output is. Then implement the convertToChange() function in changeHandler.js to verify that the tests pass.
