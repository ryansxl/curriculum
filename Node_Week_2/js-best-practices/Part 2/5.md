# Getting Rid of Switch Statements
Switch statements is a type of code used to replace long if statements. 
Below is an example of a switch statement:
    
    int x = 1; 
    switch (x) 
    { 
       case 1: printf("Choice is 1"); 
               break; 
       case 2: printf("Choice is 2"); 
               break; 
       case 3: printf("Choice is 3"); 
               break; 
       default: printf("Choice other than 1, 2 and 3"); 
                break;   
	} 
Although they can be useful in simple cases, they are often considered "code smells" when used to branch into clauses of complex logic. A code smell is when a code is designed in a way that may not intially create issues but will lead to bugs in the future. They also can be somewhat difficult to maintain compared to alternative value-retriever constructs like dictionaries. All in all, it's best to avoid switch statements if at all possible.

In this exercise, you should refactor the getAmount() method in changeHandler.js to completely remove the switch method while retaining its functionality. It doesn't matter what alternative you choose, but the method should not use a switch statement in any way.
