# Data Analysis

Now that our data is all organized onto the Dataframe, we will now analysis it.

1. First, let's see how many ***tweets* are *retweets***. This code will give you the percentage of retweets within your set of tweets.

   ```python
   #See the percentage of tweets from the initial set that are #retweets:
   RT_tweets = tweets[tweets['RT'] == True]
   print(f"The percentage of retweets is {round(len(RT_tweets)/len(tweets)*100)}% of all the tweets")
   ```

   You will notice that you will get a somewhat high percentage in retweets. This indicates that most users do not produce their own content but instead forward content from other users.

   

2. Next, we will analyze how many *tweets* are downloaded from the Streaming API that are **replies to *tweets*** of another user.

   ```python
   #See the percentage of tweets from the initial set that are replies #to tweets of another user:
   Reply_tweets = tweets[tweets['Reply'].apply(type) == str]
   print(f"The percentage of retweets is {round(len(Reply_tweets)/len(tweets)*100)}% of all the tweets")
   ```

   You will notice that the percentage is low since a small percentage of users reply to other users' tweets.

   

3. Now lets see the percentage of tweets that have **mentions but are not retweets**. Note that these *tweets* include the previous reply tweets. The tweets with mentions that are not replies or retweets are just tweets that include said mention somewhere in the middle of the text

   ```python
   #See the percentage of tweets from the initial set that have #mentions and are not retweets:
   mention_tweets = tweets[~tweets['text'].str.contains("RT")  & tweets['text'].str.contains("@")]
   print(f"The percentage of retweets is {round(len(mention_tweets)/len(tweets)*100)}% of all the tweets")
   ```



4. Lastly, lets see how many *tweets* are just **plain text *tweets***, with no mention or retweets.	

   ```python
   #See how many tweets inside are plain text tweets (No RT or mention)
   plain_text_tweets = tweets[~tweets['text'].str.contains("@")  & ~tweets['text'].str.contains("RT")]
   print(f"The percentage of retweets is {round(len(plain_text_tweets)/len(tweets)*100)}% of all the tweets")
   ```



With all of these percentage, we will now plot it and create a visualization. Continue to the next part of the activity to create the visualization.
