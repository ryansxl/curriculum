In today's activity, we are going to retrieve raw Twitter data to create cool visualizations using the Twitter Streaming API. In your previous activity, you should have learned how to download tweet data using the Streaming API. From that activity, you should have created a tweet downloading script.

You should already have your main function look like this:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':  
# Handle Twitter authetification and the connection to Twitter Streaming API
####INSERT LINE OF CODE HERE!
    l = StdOutListener()
    auth = OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)
    auth.set_access_token(access_token, access_token_secret)
    stream = Stream(auth, l)
    stream.filter(track=tracklist)
```

Right under the comment (#) portion in the main function insert this line of code and change the values of *#HASHTAG1, #HASHTAG2 and #HASHTAG3* to hashtags related to the topic you want to collect data for. More or less hashtags can be included in this list.

```python
tracklist = ['#HASHTAG1', '#HASHTAG2', '#HASHTAG3']
```

Once the script is ready, run it and pipe its output to a .txt file in this manner, like described in the aforementioned activity:

**Twitter_Downloader.py > twitter_data.txt**

Leave it running for a while, and thatâ€™s it, you got your data ready to be analyzed!
