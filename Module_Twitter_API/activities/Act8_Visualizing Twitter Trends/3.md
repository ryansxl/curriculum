# Functions to Read Data 

Now that we have read in the .txt file and have our tweets in JSON format ready, we will implement some functions to map some of the parameters of these JSON objects to columns of a Pandas dataframe where we will store the *tweets* from now on. Going back the Python file where you imported the Python modules, we will start making functions to read the data.

1. First, create a function that allows us to see if the selected *tweet* is a *retweet* or not. This is done in a by evaluating if the JSON object includes a field called ‘*retweeted status’* or not. This function returns a boolean True value if the *tweet* is a retweet, and False if its not.

   ```python
   #Create a function to see if the tweet is a retweet
   def is_RT(tweet):
       if 'retweeted_status' not in tweet:
           return False      
       else:
           return True
   ```

2. Now, evaluate if the downloaded *tweets* are a reply to some other users' *tweets*. This is done similarly to the code above but it also checks for the absence of certain fields within the JSON object. We will use the ‘*in_reply_to_screen_name*’ field, so that aside from seeing if the tweet is a response or not, we can see which user the *tweet* is responding to.

   ```python
   #Create a function to see if the tweet is a reply to a tweet of #another user, if so return said user. 
   def is_Reply_to(tweet):
       if 'in_reply_to_screen_name' not in tweet:
           return False      
       else:
           return tweet['in_reply_to_screen_name']
   ```

3. Lastly, the tweet JSON object includes a ‘*source*’ field, which is kind of an identifier of the device or application from which the *tweet* was posted. Twitter does not provide an extensive guideline on how to map this source field to actual devices. With that, create a function that can give us information to the different possible source information.

4. ```python
   #Create function for taking the most used Tweet sources off the #source column def reckondevice(tweet):
       if 'iPhone' in tweet['source'] or ('iOS' in tweet['source']):
           return 'iPhone'
       elif 'Android' in tweet['source']:
           return 'Android'
       elif 'Mobile' in tweet['source'] or ('App' in tweet['source']):
           return 'Mobile device'
       elif 'Mac' in tweet['source']:
           return 'Mac'
       elif 'Windows' in tweet['source']:
           return 'Windows'
       elif 'Bot' in tweet['source']:
           return 'Bot'
       elif 'Web' in tweet['source']:
           return 'Web'
       elif 'Instagram' in tweet['source']:
           return 'Instagram'
       elif 'Blackberry' in tweet['source']:
           return 'Blackberry'
       elif 'iPad' in tweet['source']:
           return 'iPad'
       elif 'Foursquare' in tweet['source']:
           return 'Foursquare'
       else:
           return '-'
   ```

Now that you have created all these function, we are ready to pass our tweets into a dataframe for easier processing. Move along to the next part of the activity to continue.
