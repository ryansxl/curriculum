## Import Modules

After installing it, we will now need to import this module into our program. This can be done with:

```python
from textblob import TextBlob
```

Another module that we would find useful is `re`. This stands for regular expression and we will be using it to "clean" our tweets. Using `re`, we will remove special characters, hyperlinks, and other unnecessary data that doesn't help with Sentiment Analysis. 

Import `re` like so: 

```python
import re
```
