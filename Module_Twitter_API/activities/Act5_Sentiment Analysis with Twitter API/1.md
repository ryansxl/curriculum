## Sentiment Analysis

We've used twitter's API to extract all kinds of data from tweets. Having proficiency over Tweepy will allow us to perform all kinds of tasks. 

In this activity, we will be able to take a tweet, and analyze whether it generated a positive or negative reaction.  What we are doing is called "Sentiment Analysis" and is a part of Natural Language Processing.
