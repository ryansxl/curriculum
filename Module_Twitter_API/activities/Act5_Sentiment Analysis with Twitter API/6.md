<!--title="Analyze Polarity"-->

## Interpreting the data

Going back to our `analyze_sentiment` function, `analysis` can return three types of value. If it returns a positive value, that means the sentiment about the tweet is positive. If it returns a negative value, that implies the tweet is negative. If it returns 0, we can not determine the sentiment of the tweet. 

`____.sentiment` is a function of `Textblob` that analyzes the sentiment. 

`___.sentiment.polarity` is a property of sentiment that returns the negative or positive value.

Attach an `if/else` loop onto our `analyze_sentiment` function depending on the outcome. It should look similar to this:

```python
def analyze_sentiment 
	#...
    if analysis.sentiment.polarity >0:
        return 1
    # returns 1 when the sentiment is postive 
    elif alaysis.sentiment.polarity == 0:
        return 0
    # if 0 is returned, we cannot determine the sentiment
    else: 
        return -1
    # if its not greater than zero or equal to zero, the sentiment must be positive. 
```
