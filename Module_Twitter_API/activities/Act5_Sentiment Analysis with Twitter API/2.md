<!--title="Installing Textblob"-->

## Using Textblob

The first task we have to perform is installing a python module called Textblob. 

It'd be incredibly difficult to develop our own application to analyze sentiment. We would have to train and develop our own analyzer and this is a daunting task. 

Luckily with python, we can install modules that have already been created. For this portion, we will be using a module called "Textblob". 

You can install it by going to your command prompt and typing:

```
pip install textblob
```
