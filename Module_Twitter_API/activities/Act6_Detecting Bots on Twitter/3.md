## Taking Top 25 Users

Due the the large amount of users we had, the users who has more activity is more important for us in this case. We just to see the top bit. In this case, let's say we only want to see the top 25 people. Add this code in the same file:

```python
top_users = usertweets.count(['text'].sort_values(ascending = False)[:25] 
top_users_dict = top_users.to_dict() 
user_ordered_dict = sorted(top_users_dict.items(), key=lambda x:x[1])
user_ordered_dict = user_ordered_dict[::-1]
```

The code will take the top 25 most active users and put them into a Python [dictionary](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-dictionary/), "top_users_dict", to store the data. Next, it uses the [sorted()](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sorted-function-python/) function from Python to organize the items in the dictionary. Setting the key arguement to `lambda x:x[1]` sorts values of each item based on the value of key.
