<!--title="User Activity"-->

Now we're going to see which user tweets and retweets the most and from that, we might be abele to susect some to be bots!

Add this to your code:

```python
usertweets = tweets.groupby('Username')
```

Here, tweets is a pandas dataframe object from the last activity. Then it uses the pandas function [groupby()](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-pandas-dataframe-groupby/), is used to split the data into groups. In this case, by username. All this information is assigned to user tweets which just hold it.
