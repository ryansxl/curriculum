## Detecting Bots

What are bots?

Bot is short for the word robot. They're basically an independent functioning program that is programmed to be able to interact with online users and such. For example, a bot on Twitter would be an account run by a non-human program tweeting, liking, and retweeting posts.

Let's learn to find possible bots! 

In the same file that you did the last activity, type this code:

```python
print("There are {} different users".format(tweets['Username'].nunique()) 
```

This sinpet of code will collect data of unique users from Twitter and tell you the number of of unique users there are. The Username dataframe is from your the last activity, Visualizing Twitter Trends. When ran, you will see something print like "There are 58932 different users" on your terminal.
