**Depth First Search** (**DFS**), like the **Breadth-First Search** (**BFS**) we just explored, is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

As in the example given above, DFS algorithm traverses from S to A to D to G to E to B first, then to F and lastly to C. It employs the following rules.

- **Rule 1** − Visit the adjacent unvisited vertex. Mark it as visited. Display it. Push it in a stack.
- **Rule 2** − If no adjacent vertex is found, pop up a vertex from the stack. (It will pop up all the vertices from the stack, which do not have adjacent vertices.)
- **Rule 3** − Repeat Rule 1 and Rule 2 until the stack is empty.
