This is the code used to test our DFS algorithm. We can use this block to check if our function works.

```python
g = Graph() 
g.addEdge(0, 1) 
g.addEdge(0, 2) 
g.addEdge(1, 2) 
g.addEdge(2, 0) 
g.addEdge(2, 3) 
g.addEdge(3, 3) 

print("Following is DFS from (starting from vertex 2)") 
g.DFS(2) 
```

The DFS testing is essentially identical to the BFS testing as it serves the same purpose: to construct a graph with vertices that we can traverse. The only difference is we call `g.DFS(2)` to start the DFS algorithm from vertex 2, as opposed to calling `g.BFS(2)`, which would start the BFS algorithm.

Identical to BFS, the first step in implementing a DFS algorithm is to construct a `Graph` class with an `addEdge` function. 

```python
from collections import defaultdict 

class Graph: 

	def __init__(self): 

		self.graph = defaultdict(list) 

	def addEdge(self, u, v): 
		self.graph[u].append(v) 
```

The `DFSUtil` function will be the powerhouse of implementing the DFS algorithm. As arguments, the function takes the vertex we are currently observing (`v`) and the `visited` array. Similar to that of BFS, the `visited` array is used to determine if a certain vertex has already been visited. If `visited[v] = True`, then the vertex `v` has been visited. Likewise, if `visited[v] = False`, `v` has not been visited.

Here is the code for `DFSUtil` in full. We will break it down step-by-step, but first, I wish to bring your attention to something important in these lines. What do you notice about the last line of the code? It seems like `DFSUtil` is calling the function `DFSUtil`. That is, `DFSUtil` is calling itself! When a function calls itself in its own body, it is known as a recursive function. Recognizing this is essential to understanding how the DFS algorithm is implemented.

```python
	def DFSUtil(self, v, visited): 
		visited[v] = True
		print(v, end = ' ')
    for i in self.graph[v]: 
			if visited[i] == False: 
				self.DFSUtil(i, visited) 
        
  def DFS(self, v): 
		visited = [False] * (len(self.graph)) 
		self.DFSUtil(v, visited)       
```

Back to the line-by-line breakdown of the code. 

`DFSUtil` begins by marking the vertex `v` as visited by changing `visited[v] = True`. It then prints the vertex to the console to let the user know that `v` has just been visited.

```python
visited[v] = True
print(v, end = ' ')
```

The function then enters the `for` loop. Just as in BFS, this `for` loop runs for each of the adjacent vertices of `v`. That is, `self.graph[v]` contains a list of all of the vertices from which there is an edge from `v` to it (see chart labeled *Graph In Terms of Adjacent Vertices* in the diagram below). The variable `i` stores this adjacent vertex throughout the `for` loop. The `for` loop contains an `if` statement that checks if said adjacent vertex (`i`) is unvisited (`visited[i] == False`). If this is the case, we recurse and call `DFSUtil`again, passing as arguments the adjacent vertex (`i`) and our updated `visited` array. 

```python
		for i in self.graph[v]: 
			if visited[i] == False: 
				self.DFSUtil(i, visited) 
```

Now, you might be wondering, why does this function call itself? DFS is supposed to have a stack, but I don't see any such data structure? To answer these concerns, we must diverge from the code and discuss how arguments are passed to a function.

Arguments to a function are passed through a stack, which refers to a data structure with the **L**ast-**I**n **F**irst-**O**ut (**LIFO**) functionality. When a function is called, each argument is pushed on to a stack. When a function terminates, all of the arguments are popped from the stack. 

While this does indeed occur for all arguments passed to a function, for simplicity's sake, we are going to focus our attention on how the `v` argument is pushed and popped from the stack everytime `DFSUtil` is called and terminates. 

The diagram below explains DFS step-by-step with special attention given to how recursion, passing arguments, and the stack play a role:

Often with recursive functions, we require a driver function to set-up certain values or variables before calling the recursive function. For the DFS algorithm, we have the `DFS` function serving as a driver function for the `DFSUtil` function. It first marks all vertices as not visited (the `visited` array only has `False` values) and then calls `DFSUtil` to visit the nodes.

```python
	def DFS(self, v): 
		visited = [False] * (len(self.graph)) 
		self.DFSUtil(v, visited) 
```
