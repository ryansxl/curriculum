To make a directory, you need to use the `mkdir` command to make a new directory in your home directory. Type `mkdir new_dire` and enter. By passing the directory's name to the `mkdir` command, you create a new directory in the current working directory with the name given.

You can make sub-directories inside `new_dire`. Type `mkdir new_dire/dire`. Since you're at your home directory now, you can pass a specific file path to the `mkdir` command, and place your new directory name at the end. In this case, we denote the /docs subdirectory.  Now, under your home directory, you have a directory *new_dire* and a sub-directory *docs*.
