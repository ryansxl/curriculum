In order to use the command line on your computer, you need to setup the command line tools. Below are the instructions of installing command line tools in different operating systems.

# Mac User

**Open the terminal**

- You can open Finder and search for Terminal.
- It should be located in /Application/Utilities.

**Type `xcode-select --install`**

- A popup should open asking you to install command line tools.
- Say yes.
- If you get a "not currently available error", it means that you already have it.
- Type `gcc -v` in the terminal and you should see a whole bunch of configuration values show up on the screen if things are working.

# Windows Users

**Cygwin** is an open source collection of tools that allows Unix or Linux applications to be compiled and run on a Windows operating system from within a Linux-like interface. Using Cygwin, developers can more easily provide remote support for applications running on Windows platforms.

**Download Cygwin**

- Go to https://cygwin.com/install.html and select [setup-x86_64.exe](https://cygwin.com/setup-x86_64.exe).
- Place setup-x86.exe in a location where you will be able to find again.
