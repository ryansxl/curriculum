# Present Working Directory

Every time you open the terminal or Cygwin, you're at the home directory. This is an initial directory assigned to you so that you can store personal files. To check the specific system path of your home directory, type the `pwd` command and enter. You will see a short path with the same name as your login name.

As you switch to some other directories, you can always use `pwd` command to check the complete path of your present working directory at any point of time.

[^1]: File systems are typically represented by a tree-like structure, in which any parent directory can have any number of children.
