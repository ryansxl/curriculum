Type `ls` to view the file and sub-directory in your current working directory. You should see *words.txt* and *dire*. The `ls` command will list the contents of the present working directory.

To view the contents of any other directory, you can either specify its name (if it’s a subdirectory) or its complete path (if it’s not a subdirectory) as an argument to the `ls` command.

Type `cd ~` to go back to your home directory, and type `ls new_dire/dire` to view your content in the sub-directory *dire*. The output should just be *test.log*, which is the file you have created.
