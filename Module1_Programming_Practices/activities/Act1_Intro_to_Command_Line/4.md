In order to change your current working directory to other ones, you need the `cd` command to move throughout the filesystem. It accepts a variety of arguments, from full file paths, to the names of children of the current directory, to `..` which stands for the parent of the current directory.

Type `cd new_dire/dire` to change your current directory to `~/new_dire/dire`. 

`~` is a short cut for home directory. Now, type `pwd` to see your current working directory, it should have changed accordingly.

To go back to your previous directory, type `cd ..` to switch back to your parent directory. Now, coming from `~/new_dire/dire`, you should be at `~/new_dire`.
