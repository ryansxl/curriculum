<!--concepts={Creating New Files}--> 

You can create new files in your directories by using the `touch` command. To create a new file called *words.txt* in your present working directory, type `touch words.txt`. To create a new file at a specific location, use the relative path. You are already in the directory ~/new_dire, and dire is a subdirectory of new_dire. Simply type `touch dire/test.log` to make a file named *test.log* under your sub-directory *new_dire/dire*.
