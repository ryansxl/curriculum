There are two usages to change file permissions by using the command `chmod`.

-  **Usage 1**: `chmod [usrOct groupOct otherOct] filename/direname`
  - This usage allows you to set all permissions at once with a three-digit code.
  - usrOct groupOct otherOct are three individual digits that combine together to a whole 3-digit number.
  - Individual Oct values can be either 0, 1, 2, 4 or some sum of the values.
  - 4 means read(r).
  - 2 means write(w).
  - 1 means execute(x).
  - 0 means no permissions.
- Summing the values means that you have the permissions of the numbers that make up the sum.
  - 6 = 4 + 2 which is read(r) and write(w).
  - 5 = 4 + 1 which is read(r) and execute(x).
  - 3 = 2 + 1 which is write(w) and execute(x).
  - 7 = 4 + 2 + 1 which is read(r), write(w), and execute(x).

Type `chmod 740 words.txt` to give read, write, and execute permission to the user, and the read permission to the group, and no access permissions for everyone else.

Type `ls -l` to check your work. The permission column for the file *words.txt* should be displayed as rwxr-----.

- **Usage 2**: `chmod [ugoa][+-=]{rwx} filename/direname`
  - This usage allows you to add or remove individual permissions to yourself/the group/others.
  - The {} means 1 or more of what is inside.
  - u = user (that's you).
  - g = the group you belong to.
  - o = the other (everyone else).
  - a = all (u, g, and o).
  - if neither u, g, o, or a is given, `chmod` assumes `a`.
  - \+ means add the permission.
  - \- means remove the permission.
  - = means set the permission to.

Type `chmod u-x copydire` to restrict the permission such that the user cannot search the directory *copydire*.

Check your work by either typing `ls -l` or `cd copydire`. By switching to the sub-directory *copydire*, the system gives a warning:

```
cd cpdire
bash: cd: cpdire: Permission denied
```

To regain the access for searching the directory, just type `chmod u+x cpdire` to give search permission for the user.
