Since you have the useless files *rename.txt* and *replace.txt* in the directory *new_dire*, you can use the `rm` command to remove the files.

Type `pwd` to check whether your present working directory is at *new_dire*. Change your directory if you are not there. Then, type `rm rename.txt replace.txt` to delete the files accordingly.

In order to delete a directory, you need to apply the command option again just like you did for the `cp` command. For directories, we add `-r` to delete a directory and all of its files and sub-directories recursively.

Type `rm -r cpdire/dire` to delete the sub-directory *dire* from the directory *cpdire*.

***Important***: The `rm` command does not prompt for confirmation before removing the objects, and the contents of files and directories can not be recovered once they are deleted.
