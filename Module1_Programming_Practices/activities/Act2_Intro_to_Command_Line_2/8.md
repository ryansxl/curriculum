The command `chmod` is an abbreviation of change mode. 

Make sure your present working directory is in *new_dire* by typing `pwd `. If not, then switch to that directory by typing `cd ~/new_dire`.

Type `touch words.txt` to make a file called *words.txt* in your current directory.

Write some contents into the file:

```
echo "Hi, my name is John." > words.txt
echo "I have a brother named Peter." >> words.txt
echo "Peter is taller and skinner than me." >> words.txt
```

Now, to see more details in your directory. Type `ls -l` to see more information.

You should see the following rows and columns:

```
total 1
drwxr-xr-x+ 1 *owner name* *owner group* 0 *created time* copydire
-rw-r--r--  1 *owner name* *owner group* 0 *created time* words.txt
```

- The very first column represents the type of the file - i.e. is it a normal file or a
  directory - where d represents a directory and – (a dash) represents a normal file.
- The first set of three letters after the file type tell what permissions the owner of the file has. There are three possible permissions: r(read), w(write) and x(execute). The existence of the letter indicates that the owner has that permission, whereas a dash indicates the owner does not. For example: In *words.txt*, the owner has the rw- permission, which means the owner can only read(r) and write(w) the file but cannot execute(x).
- The next three letters after the user’s permission are the group’s permissions. (In some cases a group, of which the owner is a part of, will own a file.)
- Note that when a directory has the 'x' set, this takes the special meaning of “permitted to search this directory”.
- The last three letters in the permissions column tell us what “others” may do. The general practice is to protect the files from external access so that others can’t write any files or directories. They may read(r) or execute(x) it. For example: The words.txt has others permission as r–– which means it can only be read by other(external) access but cannot be written or executed by them.
- Note: The 3rd and 4th columns represents the name of the owner of the file and the group to which the owner belongs respectively.
