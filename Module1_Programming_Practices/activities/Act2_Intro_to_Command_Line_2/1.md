The behavior of shell commands can be modified by **command line options**. These entries can pass along cues for changing various settings or executing variants of commands.

They are commonly represented by a single letter followed by a `-`. For example, `-l`, `-a`, `-d` could all be options that follow a shell command.

Back to the discussion about copying directories above, type `cp -r dire copydire` (`-r` can either be lowercase or uppercase) to create a new directory *copydire* and recursively copy all the files from *dire*. Now, type `ls copydire dire` to check the content of both directories, and you should see that both of them contain the file *test.log*.

Notice that if the directory *copydire* **already exists** before executing the `cp` command, then the copy of *dire* becomes a **sub-directory** under *copydire*.

Since you have created the directory *cpdire*, type `cp -r dire cpdire` again, and then `ls cpdire`. Notice that *cpdire* has a file *test.log* and a sub-directory *dire*.

Here is a more specific explanation for copying a directory to an existing directory and to a non-existing directory:

```
$ cp - r dire copydire //Copying dire to a non-existing copydire.
$ ls copydire
test.log // Copied the file from dire to copydire.

$ cp -r dire cpdire // Copying dire to an existing cpdire.
$ ls cpdire
test.log  dire // Copied dire as a sub-directory under cpdire.
```
