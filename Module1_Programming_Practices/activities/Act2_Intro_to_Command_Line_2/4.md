# Useful Tips

You can press the `up arrow` to go back to previous commands. Type any multiple commands such as`ls cpdire`, `cd cpdire`, and `ls`. Press the up arrow multiple times and you will see the same commands that you have typed.

When typing the name of a file or a path, if you press the `Tab` key it will autocomplete for you. Try `ls cp` then press the `Tab` key, and you will see that the system generated the command `ls cpdire/` automatically for you.

You can type `clear` to clear the screen.
