You can use the `mv` command to move files or directories, either a single one or multiple ones, from one place to another.

Make sure you are in the directory ~/new_dire. Type `mv copy.txt copydire` to move the file *copy.txt* from the directory *new_dire* to *copydire*. Check the content of *new_dire* and *copydire* by typing `ls` and `ls copydire` separately. You should notice that the file *copy.txt* is moved from *new_dire* to *copydire*.

You can also do the same thing between directories by simply giving two directory names as arguments. Type `mv dire cpdire` to make *dire* a sub-directory of *copydire*.

The syntax for `mv` is:

`mv [Option] source destination`

If the *destination* **doesn't exist**, it will rename the *source* to be the *destination*. Type `mv words.txt rename.txt` to rename the file *words.txt* to *rename.txt*. Check your work by typing `ls`. **Note that this is how you rename files in command line. ** There is no renaming command, we simply use `mv`.

If the *destination* **exists**, it will be overwritten and the source file will be deleted. Type `mv cpdire/test.log replace.txt`. You will see that the *test.log* is deleted, and the directory *new_dire* has a new file called *replace.txt*. Note, *replace.txt* appears in the directory because you have executed the command in your present working directory, which is *new_dire*.

 By default, `mv` doesn't prompt for overwriting the existing file, so be careful.
