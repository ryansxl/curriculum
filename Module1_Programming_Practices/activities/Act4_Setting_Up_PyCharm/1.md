In this activity, we will introduce the installation of PyCharm on different operating systems. PyCharm is an integrated development environment used in computer programming, specifically for the Python language. It has many useful add-in features for you to develop programs faster and more comfortably.

Check the `64-bit laungher`, `Add launchers dir to PATH`, and `Add "Open Folder as Project"` options. You may want to leave the association option blank if you don't want any file with a `.py` suffix be associated with Pycharm. Click `Next`.

If you have checked the `Add launchers dir to PATH` option you will need to restart your computer to complete the installation.

After restarting your computer, reopen PyCharm and check `Do not import settings`, then click `OK`.

Select a UI theme for your PyCharm, then click `Next: Featured plugins`.

You could install *Markdown* if you so choose, but do not install *IdeaVim* unless you're familiar with Vim. Click `Start using Pycharm`.

Now, you have successfully installed PyCharm on your computer!
