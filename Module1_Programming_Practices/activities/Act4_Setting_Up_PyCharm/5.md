After you've added new files to the Git repository, or modified files that are already under Git version control and you are happy with their current state, you can share the results of your work.

# Commit Changes Locally

Following your Pycharm directory *testing4* from previous card, create a new file called *local_change.py* by entering the `touch local_change.py` command in your terminal.

Type the following code in your new Python file:

```python
print("This is part 1 of the file")
print("This is part 2 of the file")

print("This is part 3 of the file")
```

Select this file on the left and press `Ctrl+K` to open the **Commit Changes** dialog that lists all files that have been modified since the last commit, and all newly added unversioned files.

Enter the commit message as "This is a local commit." Check *local_change.py* at the bottom of the list. Then click **Commit**.

# Push Changes to a Remote Repository

PyCharm allows you to upload changes from the current branch to any other remote branch (provided you have permission).

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+K` or choose **VCS | Git | Push** from the main menu to open the **Push Commits dialog**.

2. Since you have checked out to a remote repository, the commit will be pushed to your GitHub repo that you have connected. [^1] Now, 

3. If you want to preview changes before pushing them, select the required commit. The right-hand pane shows the changes included in the selected commit. Double click the file's name on the right hand pane, and you will see all the new changes:

4. Come back to the push dialog and click the **Push** button.

5. After successfully pushing the commit, the changes will be reflected on your GitHub repository. Go to the corresponding GitHub repo, and you will see that the local file *local_change.py* is added in your remote repo:

[^1]:If there are no remotes in the repository, the **Define remote** link appears. Click this link and specify the remote name and URL in the dialog that opens. It will be saved and you can edit it later via **VCS | Git | Remotes**.
