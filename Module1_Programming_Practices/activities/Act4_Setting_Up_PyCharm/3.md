PyCharm lets you manage your projects hosted on GitHub directly from the IDE (PyCharm). You need to first log into your GitHub account on PyCharm. If you don't have a GitHub account, you can register one [here](https://github.com/join?source=header-home).

After that, come back to PyCharm and open the setting dialog by pressing `Ctrl + Alt + S`. Select **Version Control** then **GitHub** in the left pane.

Click **Add account**. Then, fill out your GitHub account and password, and click **login**. Now, you have successfully connected your GitHub account to PyCharm!

# Clone a Project From a Remote Host

PyCharm allows you to check out (or in Git terms, **clone**) an existing repository and create a new project based on the data you've downloaded.

Here are step by step instructions on checking out a project from your GitHub:

1. If you haven't opened any project, click **Checkout from Version Control | Git**. Otherwise, from the main navigation bar on the top, choose **VCS | Checkout from Version Control | Git**.

2. In the **Clone Repository** dialog, specify the URL of the remote repository you want to clone (the **Test** can make sure that connection to the remote can be established).

If you have gone through the GitHub activity, you should have created one GitHub repository. Go to your GitHub home page and find your repository, then go into that repository's page.

Click the green button **Clone or download**, and copy the URL to your PyCharm:

   <center><img src="https://projectbit.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/darlene/md/Setting+Up+PyCharm/pycharm_github5.png" alt="img" style="zoom:67%;" /></center>

In the **directory** field, specify the path where the folder for your local Git repository for your clone will be created.

3. Click **Clone** and then **Yes**. 

# Put an Existing Project under Version Control

You can also import your local project into a single Git repository.

Below is the three simple steps:

1. Open a new project from the **File** on the top left of your navigation bar, choose **Pure Python**, and specify a location where you will remember. Open the new project in **This Window**.

2. From the main menu, choose **VCS | Import into Version Control | Create Git Repository**.

   <center><img src="https://projectbit.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/darlene/md/Setting+Up+PyCharm/import_git.png" alt="img" style="zoom: 50%;" /></center>

3. In the dialog that opens, specify the directory where a new Git repository will be created (in this case, it's the location of your current new project).

# Add Files to the Local Repository

After initializing a Git repository for your project, you can add project data to it.

Go to the **Terminal** in Pycharm and enter this command `touch test.py` to create a Python program called *test.py*.

<center><img src="https://projectbit.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/darlene/md/Setting+Up+PyCharm/add_file.png" alt="img" style="zoom: 60%;" /></center>

You will notice that the color of your new added file is different and PyCharm, and PyCharm suggests to add each newly created file under Git version control (you can change this behavior in the **Settings** dialog `Ctrl+Alt+S`).

This file is unversioned, meaning that it is not yet under version control by Git repository. To add it to your local repository, you can allow **Always Add** for the option **Externally added files can be added to Git**. Or, you can right-click the file's name, and choose **Git | Add** or use the shortcut, `Ctrl+Alt+A` when you're on the file that you want to add to your local repository.

<img src="https://projectbit.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/darlene/md/Setting+Up+PyCharm/add_file2.png" alt="img" style="zoom:60%;" />

You will notice that the color of your file's name changed again, to color green, and that means the file is now under version control by your git repository.

# Exclude Files From Version Control

Sometimes you may want to leave certain files unversioned. For instance you may have a file containing sensitive credentials or you have made your own test files that you don't want to share with collaborators. You can ignore files through PyCharm, and IDE will not suggest adding them to Git and will highlight them as ignored.

To do this, we need to add files to **.gitignore**:

1. Check your working directory on the left side to see whether you have the *.gitignore* file in it. If not, you can create one by typing the command `touch .gitignore` in your Pycharm terminal. Enter `touch new.py` to make a new unversioned file in your working directory.

2. Now, you may find any unversioned files in the **Version Control too window** by pressing the shortcut `Alt+9`, and switch to **Local Change**. Locate the file *new.py* in the **Unversioned Files**.

   <center><img src="https://projectbit.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/darlene/md/Setting+Up+PyCharm/gitignore2.png" alt="img" style="zoom:60%;" /></center>

3. Right-click *new.py* and choose **Add to .gitignore**.

   <center><img src="https://projectbit.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/darlene/md/Setting+Up+PyCharm/gitignore3.png" alt="img" style="zoom:60%;" /></center>

4. Another way to do exclude a file from version control is to choose any file you want on the left side, right click the file's name and choose **Git | Add to .gitignore**.

   <center><img src="https://projectbit.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/darlene/md/Setting+Up+PyCharm/gitignore4.png" alt="img" style="zoom:60%;" /></center>

5. The color denoting VC-excluded file is also different from other files, which is dark yellow.

# Check Project Status

PyCharm allows you to check the status of your local working copy compared to the repository version of the project. It uses specific colors to let you see which files have been modified, which new files have been added to the VCS, and which files are not being tracked by Git.

Open the **Version Control** tool window Alt+9 and switch to the **Local Changes** tab:

<center><img src="https://projectbit.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/darlene/md/Setting+Up+PyCharm/Git_file_status.png" alt="img" style="zoom:60%;" /></center>

- The **Default** change list shows all files that have been modified since you last synchronized with the remote repository (highlighted in blue), and all new files that have been added to the VCS but have not been committed yet (highlighted in green).
- The **Unversioned Files** change list shows all files that have been added to your project, but that are not being tracked by Git.
